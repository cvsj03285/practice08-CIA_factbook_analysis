# Guided Project - Analyzing CIA Factbook Data Using SQL

In this project, we'll work with data from the [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/), a compendium of 
statistics about all of the countries on Earth. The Factbook contains demographic information like:
- population - The population as of 2015.
- population_growth - The annual population growth rate, as a percentage.
- area - The total land and water area.

We'll use SQL in Jupyter notebook to explore and analyze data.
Here are the descriptions for some of the columns:

- name - The name of the country.
- area- The country's total area (both land and water).
- area_land - The country's land area in [square kilometers](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2147rank.html).
- area_water - The country's waterarea in square kilometers.
- population - The country's population.
- population_growth- The country's population growth as a percentage.
- birth_rate - The country's birth rate, or the number of births a year per 1,000 people.
- death_rate - The country's death rate, or the number of death a year per 1,000 people.

Let's use SQL to search and explore the data we're interested.
